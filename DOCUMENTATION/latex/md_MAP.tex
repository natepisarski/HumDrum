This nifty document will guide you around the \hyperlink{namespaceHumDrum}{Hum\+Drum} library, describing both what each wing of the library does and what its sub-\/sections consist of.

\subsection*{Collections}

Collections is the wing of the \hyperlink{namespaceHumDrum}{Hum\+Drum} library that deals with any function performed on a series of (commonly) generic data.

\subsubsection*{Markov}

Markov is a subsection of collections that sets up the relevant data structure for working with Markov chains, a state-\/dependant prediction of future states.

\paragraph*{Markov\+State}

Represents one item of a markov chain. Holds some kind of state, a future value, and the probability that the future state will occur when its state is reached.

\paragraph*{Markov}

Markov is the actual class for working with these chains. Its constructor takes a sequence of data which is automatically turned into a list of Markov\+States. When a state is given to this object, it can either return the most likely future states or a state at random (a-\/la many message generators).

\subsubsection*{State\+Modifiers}

State\+Modifiers is a library suite for Hum\+Drum.\+Collections.\+Groups.\+State\+Object$<$\+T$>$ subclasses. These work as hodge-\/podgey implementations of state machines.

\paragraph*{Integer\+Counter}

Integer\+Counter is a pretty simple state machine. It takes a maximum value and a step-\/increase value (i.\+e, step increase value of 2 would make it go \{2, 4, 6\} etc.).

\subsubsection*{Groups}

Groups is a library for using a state machine (State\+Object$<$\+T$>$ defined in this class) to group information in a sequence.

\subsubsection*{Higher\+Order}

Higher\+Order is a library that mimics L\+I\+N\+Q-\/style queries for generic collection structures. These functions allow various other kinds of functions to be passed in as a parameter to control how these work.

\subsubsection*{Information}

Information is a very general library. Any function that pertains to extracting existing elements of a list as-\/is, or providing metadata about the list itself will wind up here. This library is the \char`\"{}other half\char`\"{} of the Transformations library, but it does not type of manipulation to the list.

\subsubsection*{Predicates}

Predicates is a library for dealing with analysis on sequences of boolean values.

\subsubsection*{Sections}

Sections is a library for parsing text. It defines various ways to group and extract strings from source material.

\subsubsection*{Transformations}

Transformations is another general collections library. The \char`\"{}other half\char`\"{} of Information, Transformations defines ways to manipulate a list to turn it into a different structure. This is either a reordered list or another data structure entirely.

\subsection*{Operations}

Operations is the wing of the \hyperlink{namespaceHumDrum}{Hum\+Drum} library pertaining to I\+O, or some very particular task.

\subsubsection*{Files}

Files is a subsection of Operations that relates to operations of files / directories.

\paragraph*{Directory\+Search}

Directory\+Search is a library for searching directories recursively for files meeting some type of criteria. Using method cascading, heavy refining of included files is made very easy with Directory\+Search.

\paragraph*{Line}

Line is a simple class that represents the line of a file. Lines are wrapped in this class so that their parent file and line number can be referenced even after it is separated from such a context.

\paragraph*{I\+Sequential\+Writer}

Sequential\+Writer is an interface defining two things\+: the writing of a file with an extension and the naming of such a file based on the directory. In short, anything that scans the directory to determine what the next file should be named can be a Sequential\+Writer

\paragraph*{Numerical\+Writer}

Numerical\+Writer is a Sequential\+Writer that scans the directory for numbered files, starting at 0.

\subsubsection*{Image\+Manager}

A library for calculating image metadata. This includes functions such as the average color, most similar image based on color, and image searching.

\subsubsection*{Logger}

Logger writes information to an Output\+Stream. Logger is commonly used on File\+Output\+Streams to create log files.

\subsubsection*{Servitor}

Servitor is a server program that listens on a given port and buffers input. Then, the client can read information from this buffer. This wraps the shockingly low-\/level .N\+E\+T network library.

\subsection*{Recursion}

Recursion is a suite of libraries that assist or make heavy use of recursive functions.

\subsubsection*{Tail\+Helper}

Tail\+Helper contains functions that assist in tail-\/recursion, especially in translating data.

\subsection*{Structures}

Structures is the wing of \hyperlink{namespaceHumDrum}{Hum\+Drum} that defines data structures.

\subsubsection*{Bindings\+Table}

Bindings\+Table contains functions for manipulating two lists of information, and manipulating lists of points. This can also be used a simple key-\/value database.

\subsubsection*{Direction}

A very simple enum for Up, Down, Left, Right.

\subsubsection*{Tree}

A simple implementation of a binary tree.
