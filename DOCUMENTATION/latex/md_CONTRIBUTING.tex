The barrier to entry for this project is exceedingly small. The purpose of \hyperlink{namespaceHumDrum}{Hum\+Drum} is to not have a purpose. Put your code where you think that it fits in best (or, hell, make your won file. Want to get R\+E\+AL crazy? Make you own Wing!), write the tests for it (as long as it\textquotesingle{}s not networking code), and send a pull request. I\textquotesingle{}ll put it in and credit you for the work.

I do ask, that if you have been given master push access that you use push.\+sh in the root of this directory. That just makes it easier to edit the version number and R\+E\+A\+D\+ME files.
