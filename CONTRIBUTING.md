# How to Contribute
The barrier to entry for this project is exceedingly small. The purpose of HumDrum is to not have a purpose. Put your code where you think that it fits in best (or, hell, make your won file. Want to get REAL crazy? Make you own Wing!), write the tests for it (as long as it's not networking code), and send a pull request. I'll put it in and credit you for the work.

I do ask, that if you have been given master push access that you use push.sh in the root of this directory. That just makes it easier to edit the version number and README files.
