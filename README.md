# HumDrum
HumDrum is a collection of utilities that I commonly use in my C# programs. For those familiar with my past projects (Archimedes, Cookbook, etc.), this is nothing new. Any function or class that is not directly related to the development of a certain application will wind up in HumDrum.

# Layout
My experience with general library development has been mostly functional, with functions spread across a couple of "wings". This is architecture is maintained with HumDrum, but to a lesser extent. There are currently 4 wings:

* Collections: Functions related to manipulating collections
* Operations: Non-pure operations, like Logging and Network communication
* Recursion: Functions that either perform recursively or assist with the development of recursive functions
* Structures: Data structures
