# HumDrum
This is the repository for HumDrum, a general-purpose C# library covering functions mostly related to lists of information. It provides well documented, tested, code for all sorts of general purpose C# computing.

# Branches
HumDrum is split up into 3 branches. Operations, Structures, and Collections.

### Operations
Operations relates to state-based operations. TCP stuff / Directory searching and things like that.

### Structures
Structures, as its name suggests, relates to generic data structures such as binary trees and binding tables.

### Collections
Collections deal with sequences of information. Whether that be transforming the data, ascertaining more information about it, or running some type of analysis - list stuff goes here.

# Methodology
Why does something end up here? Well, basically, I just program as I normally would. Then, anything that doesn't pertain *directly* to the project I'm working on gets slapped into HumDrum. If you have something that you think would be a good fit in here, chances are it actually is a good fit - send a pull request.
